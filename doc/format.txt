Attribute Display
=================

A long list of attributes is all fine for displaying items.  However it's not
so useful for human display.  For starters many attributes should not be
displayed by default.  Others may need to be formated in a particular way.

The rules are:
 - By default each attribute is _not_ displayed.
 - If the attribute is in a group it is displayed in the group
 - If the attribute has the same name as a group, it is displayed as the
 group.


Formatting Values
-----------------

The default formatting of a value is simply the numeric version of the
attributes value (from neb_attr_value_get).  There are 2 properties 'props' of
concern: "Format" and "Subvalue".

If the "Subvalue" property exists it will refer to another attribute, whose
value should also be got from 'neb_attr_value_get()'

If there is NO subvalue:
	If format exists: Use format as printf style string, with a single %d.
	If no format use the format string '%d'.

If there is a subvalue:
	if format exists: use format string with value and subvalue.
	Use format string "%d (%+d)" with value and subvalue.
